Description: This implements the basic financial analysis
    functions similar to (but not identical to) what
    is available in most spreadsheet software. This

    spaced cash flows and annuities. Bond pricing and
    YTM calculations are included. In addition, Black
    Scholes option pricing and Greeks are also
    provided.
